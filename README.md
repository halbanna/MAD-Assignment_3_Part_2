IoT Device Control App

This Flutter app allows users to control a selection of IoT devices in their home, including turning them on and off. The app features a grid layout of the devices and displays their current status (on or off). Tapping on a device's icon will toggle its status and update the display accordingly.

The app also includes tabs at the bottom, allowing users to switch between different rooms or categories of devices.
